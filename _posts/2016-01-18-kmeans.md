This quick post started as a challenge to myself: "I wonder if I can bang out a
[k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) implementation with
visualization from memory in less than 2 game of thrones episodes..." The
result is an immutable, functional implementation in ES6 including a
visualization in [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

The na√Øve algorithm is pretty simple:

* decide on a distance measure (e.g.
  [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) distance)
* decide a-priori how many clusters you want and randomly position the centroid
  in the feature space.
* now iteratively
  * assign each point to a cluster based on minimum distance to the centroids
  * move the centroids to the actual cluster centroid positions
  * repeat until change below threshold

The Euclidean version is well suited to find circular clusters, the choice of
measure always depends on the problem at hand. Also there are approaches to 
infer the optimal number of clusters, but that is left to a post in the future.
