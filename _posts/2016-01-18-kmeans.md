k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal
processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means
clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each
observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a
prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into
Voronoi cells.
