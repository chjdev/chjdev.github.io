BRVTY is the result of a quick Sunday afternoon hack. It shortens web articles based on the LSA article.
Just drag the bookmarklet (image) to your bookmark bar and press it on an article you want to have shortened.

(That was just a quick fun hack, if your interested in sources etc. drop me a note.)
